Assignments developed in the Artificial intelligence course at [INF](https://inf.ufrgs.br)-[UFRGS](https://ufrgs.br).

## Assignment #1 (search): Graph search for 8-puzzle solutions
- Implemented algorithms: BFS, DFS, A* Hamming/Manhattan

## Assignment #2 (othello): Creation of an artificial intelligence agent for the Othello game
- Agent implemented with the Monte Carlo algorithm
- See our agent (invictus^-1) playing in the course agent competition: [Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/live/44ZjUUF88lk?feature=share&t=3044)

## Assignment #3 (optimization): Separated in two tasks:
- Implementation of genetic algorithm to solve eight queen problem
- Implementation of gradient descent algorithm to create a linear regression to predict the price of farms from a dummy dataset

## Assignment #4 (berkeleyRL3): Implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms and analysis of the influence of some parameters
